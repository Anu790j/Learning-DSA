While following with Love Babbar videos and involving myself to learn Data Structures and Algorithm.
I come up with new following approches and topic that make me better at solving problems

1. Pseudocode,Flowchart and basic of Problem Solving.
2. Basics of C++ kanguage like if else,Loops(for and while)
3. Basic of Pattern Printing
4. Opreators(Arthimetic,logic and Relationship) and using them for Binary and decimal conversion.
5. Problem Solving insights and how to to solve the given problem from scratch.
6. Switch Statement and Functions
7. Arrays(Use of XOR ,how to solve the problem using constraint given in problem itself and 2 pointer approch)
